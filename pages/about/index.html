        <p>I am a web developer from Long Beach, California. I graduated
          from California State University, Long Beach,
          earning a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems with cum laude Honor, in the fall of
          2018. Since graduating, I have been working with a few local businesses to help them establish an online
          presence. I love building with the JavaScript ecosystem (Vanilla JS, React, Node), but I have experience with
          various other technologies and
          I always enjoy finding something new to learn.

        <p>My first taste of programming was a Python course at CSULB. I was hooked and needed more. I took additional
          courses in database design and advanced database development, web development, and information security (a
          second passion of
          mine).
          Although I would be more than happy to learn any programming language or technology needed to get the job
          done, I am currently focusing on JavaScript development to hone my skills. Through my coursework, self-study,
          and freelance work I have gained valuable experience with Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.JS, SQL, PL/SQL,
          MySQL, Postgres, Git, JSON, and AJAX. I also have a few years of experience as a wedding photographer where I
          learned to use Photoshop and Illustrator.

        <p>Over the summer of 2018 I participated in First American Title’s corporate internship program as an
          Information Security Intern, where I leveraged Excel and PowerPoint to produce reports and presentations for
          the Risk, Controls, and Compliance team. I also assisted with the “Top 80” project, where we conducted
          self-assessments of the company’s top 80 “mission critical” web applications to ensure that they were
          safeguarding data according to First American’s policies and standards. Lastly, I worked on an IT intern group
          project where we helped First American’s Innovation Team build automation bots for repetitive tasks within the
          company. </p>

      <div class="experience-text-container">
        <p>My first job at Whole Foods Market was Dishwasher, and I quickly realized that it was the worst job in the
          world. The dishes. Never. Stop. Coming. EVER! So, I started asking for training in other areas of the
          department. If I had a few minutes to spare, I had a few minutes to learn something. Eventually, I was sent to
          another store for a crash course in cooking. It was a 3 day bootcamp. When I returned to my home store I was
          the new cook. Let's just say I burned the rice on more than one occasion. But after a short while and more
          than a few
          hours sitting at Barnes & Noble reading cook books, I got the hang of it and I became the lead cook.
          <br /><br />Over the
          years, I made my way up the ladder to Supervisor, Associate Team Leader, and eventually Team Leader. I led a
          team of 40 team members and managed all department operations, including purchasing, budgets,
          inventory management, scheduling, hiring, and team member discipline & reviews.</p>
