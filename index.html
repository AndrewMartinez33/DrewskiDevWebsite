        <p>Someday, NASA will make me an honorary astronaut and send me off into space. If not, I know Elon Musk has my
          back. But here on Earth I am an aspiring web developer.<br /><br />Throughout my academic career, I've thought
          about
          being an
          economist, an accountant, a photographer, etc. But none of them were any fun. There's something about sitting
          in front of a screen for hours, pulling my hair out, trying to figure out why my code won't run, and then
          realizing that it was just a syntax error, that makes web development fun! And I also love the problem
          solving,
          the creativity, and the never-ending opportunities to learn something new that comes with web development.
          <br /><br />I graduated
          from California State University, Long Beach,
          earning a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems with Cum Laude Honor, in the fall of 2018. My journey
          in web development is just beginning and I am
          looking for a
          place to call home, where I can grow my skillset and contribute to the business.</p>

        <p>My first taste of programming was a Python course at CSULB. I was hooked and needed more. I took additional
          courses in database design and SQL development, web development, and information security (a second passion of
          mine). I also do a lot of self-learning, spending most of my free time trying to expand my skillset and
          talking to my wife about web development. I know she's had enough when her eyes start to glaze over.
          <br /><br />
          Although I would be more than happy to learn any programming language or technology needed to get the job
          done, I am currently focusing on JavaScript development to hone my skills. I am well versed in HTML, CSS,
          vanilla JS, and I am
          teaching myself React.JS. Eventually, I will move to the backend with Node.JS. I also have experience with
          SQL, PL/SQL, T-SQL, Git, JSON, and AJAX. I also spent a few years trying to become a photographer, which gave
          me some good experience with Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.

        <p>Over the summer of 2018 I participated in First American Title’s corporate internship program as an
          Information Security Intern, where I leveraged Excel and PowerPoint to produce reports and presentations for
          the Risk, Controls, and Compliance team. I also assisted with the “Top 80” project, where we conducted
          self-assessments of the company’s top 80 “mission critical” web applications to ensure that they were
          safeguarding data according to First American’s policies and standards. Lastly, I worked on an IT intern group
          project where we helped First American’s Innovation Team build automation bots for repetitive tasks within the
          company. </p>

      <div class="experience-text-container">
        <p>My first job at Whole Foods Market was Dishwasher, and I quickly realized that it was the worst job in the
          world. The dishes. Never. Stop. Coming. EVER! So, I started asking for training in other areas of the
          department. If I had a few minutes to spare, I had a few minutes to learn something. Eventually, I was sent to
          another store for a crash course in cooking. It was a 3 day bootcamp. When I returned to my home store I was
          the new cook. Let's just say I burned the rice on more than one occasion. But after a short while and more
          than a few
          hours sitting at Barnes & Noble reading cook books, I got the hang of it and I became the lead cook.
          <br /><br />Over the
          years, I made my way up the ladder to Supervisor, Associate Team Leader, and eventually Team Leader. I led a
          team of 40 team members and managed all department operations, including purchasing, budgets,
          inventory management, scheduling, hiring, and team member discipline & reviews.</p>
